[How do I install SSL/TLS certificates on Amazon CloudFront?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/install-ssl-cloudfront/)

    - Follow the instructions found within the install ssl cloudfront link => Requires following the instructions for creating the certificate through either the AWS Console or the AWS CLI.
    - If the record is successfully validated, add the output value to the record set. (I purchased my name through Route53, so the ACM was )
[How To Store Secrets Using Parameter Store](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/the-right-way-to-store-secrets-using-parameter-store/)


In Certificate Manager, the ARN option is not visible by default

The CLI command listed in the repo did not work for me, so I just had to click through the CLI. 


Some wonkiness in getting this to run "out of the box" on a windows machine. 


Failing at the path. => y tho

`./node_modules/aws-cdk/bin/cdk list --verbose`

Looks like the config stuff lives here
```
aws-cdk/lib/settings.d.ts
```

General vicinity of the error
`exec.js` 
```
const outdir = await fs.mkdtemp(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'cdk'));
```

Context API
```
const cxapi = require("@aws-cdk/cx-api");
```

 * - The versions are not compared in a semver way, they are used as
 *    opaque ordered tokens.
 * - The version needs to be set to the NEXT releasable version when it's
 *   updated (as the current verison in package.json has already been released!)
 * - The request does not have versioning yet, only the response.

...I forgot to add 
`node /path/to/application`

Had to add AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess and pass the parameter option
Had to update value name for the tag name to actually work
